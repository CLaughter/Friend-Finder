How does it work?
This is a full stack node app deployed on Heroku using Express to configure and operate the server, Body-Parser to pass the json data back and forth between files & functions, and fs to read & write from the data files on the server. Various routes are setup to complete the survey, view the JSON API, and post data into the app. A general catch-all route will bring all users to the homepage, regardless of the path the user attempts to access.

Who will use this?
Casual users looking to see who they best resemble will enjoy the app. A community of friends, co-workers, or students can compare their interests to each other as well.

What is the goal?
The goal is to use deceptively deep personality questions to link 2 users together with a common bond. Many great questions and ideas were discovered during my research, but few translated well into a scale of 1-5. Sites like Power Of Positivity were helpful in taking the theories and adjusting them to a simple scale.

Deployment
Deployment on a node server is required. This app is setup to listen on a Heroku default port; in the absence of Heroku, it sets the port to 8080 instead. Since no database management is required, setup should be a simple matter of simply uploading the files and having the server listen for a request.
